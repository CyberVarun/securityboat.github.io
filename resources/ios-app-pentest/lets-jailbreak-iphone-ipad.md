### **Steps to jailbreak**&#x20;

**1. Check the current version running in the device. if the version in between 11 - 12.4 then unc0ver exploit will work.**

&#x20;**2. As you see my device has iOS v12.4. hence unc0ver will work fine for this version.**\
&#x20;**So now open the device and visit the URL"https://app.app-valley.vip/"  or "https://iosninja.io/ipa-library" and click on the "unc0ver jailbreak". and the app gets downloaded.**

\
&#x20;**3. Now open the app and see it will show an error. in order to run any app from an external source (outside Appstore), we need to trust before running in the device.**

**4.** **Go to Setting->General->Profile& Device Management.**

**5. Click on trust and verify the app.**

**6. Now open the app and click on the jailbreak button. (My device is already jailbroken that's why it Showing re-jailbreak)**

**7. And its start jailbreaking the device. Make sure the device is in Aeroplane mode sometimes exploit won't work if the device is not on aeroplane mode. Also if it stuck just press home button and back again in-app and it will work fine.**

&#x20;**8. Once is done with this it shows a pop-up message with "jailbreak Competed" press OK Button.**

**9. Now the device will get respring and enter the passCode.**

&#x20;**10. To verify the device is jailbroken or not let's take SSH to the device. to take ssh to find the IP address of the device.**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sQQVfcKEfZg/XkWtc--voDI/AAAAAAAAEIg/BOHzwx4lK9ABHV4nBmj8sHWkimfj1kZCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/Image-1.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sQQVfcKEfZg/XkWtc--voDI/AAAAAAAAEIg/BOHzwx4lK9ABHV4nBmj8sHWkimfj1kZCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image-1.jpg)

&#x20;**11. IP Address may differ in your case. the default root password will be "alpine" and see we are a root user nowðŸ˜Ž**

&#x20;Once you done with the jailbreak a new app "**Cydia**" will appear in-app menu. it's nothing but the Appstore for the jailbroken device. we will see depth about this while setting up a lab for pentesting.

&#x20;Will setup tool for ios pentesting in next post.
