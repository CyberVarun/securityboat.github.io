# **Thick Client Pentesting**

Thick client applications, called desktop applications, are full-featured computers that are connected to a network. Unlike thin clients, which lack hard drives and other features, thick clients are functional whether they are connected to a network or not.

While a thick client is fully functional without a network connection, it is only a “client” when it is connected to a server. The server may provide the thick client with programs and files that are not stored on the local machine’s hard drive
