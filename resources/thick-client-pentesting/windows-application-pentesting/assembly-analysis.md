# Assembly analysis

To get dive deeper into security, it is necessary to decompile and analyze the application at the binary level. So, first of all, when we decompile the application, if the code is readable, it means that the code is not obfuscated, which is a security issue. Once memory pages get the source code, we can look for sensitive hardcoded information for the backdooring applications, including passwords, keys, secrets, or information.&#x20;

We can use the GET-PESecurity tool to check binary protection, which you will get from here.

Things to check for -

ASLR: Address space layout randomization is a computer security technique that prevents the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

DEP: Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is a system-level memory protection feature built into the operating system, starting with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. DEP enables the system to mark one or more pages of memory as non-executable.

SafeSEH: SafeSEH (Safe Structured Exception Handlers) is a Windows binary protection mechanism for 32-bit executables that have been around for a while now.

StrongNaming: Strong naming refers to signing an assembly with a key, producing a strong-named assembly. When an assembly is strong-named, it creates a unique identity based on the name and assembly version number, and it can help prevent assembly conflicts.

Authenticode: Authenticode is a Microsoft code-signing technology that identifies the publisher of Authenticode-signed software. Authenticode also verifies that the software has not been tampered with since it was signed and published. Authenticode uses cryptographic techniques to verify publisher identity and code integrity.

ControlFlowGuard: Control Flow Guard (CFG) is a highly-optimized platform security feature created to combat memory corruption vulnerabilities.

HighEntropyVA: Specifies whether the executable image supports high-entropy 64-bit address space layout randomization (ASLR

Once we identified whether all the protection was missing or not&#x20;

Check whether the app is signed or not by using signcheck.exe, which you can get in sysinternaltools.
