# Registry Monitoring

Monitor registry with \`regshot\`, which allow monitoring registry by timestamp that takes a screenshot before and after, which helps to monitor change over the registry easily. It is necessary to check whether it is storing any sensitive information in the registry or not. In case if any role information is stored in the registry, then we can try to manipulate them and check whether our privileges have been escalated.

Other than this, it is also necessary to check the permissions, whether it has written permission or not. If it has written permissions so it will consider as dangerous.
