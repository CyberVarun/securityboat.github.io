# Buffer Overflow

A buffer overflow condition exists when a program attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold or when a program tries to put data in a memory area past a buffer. In this case, a buffer is a sequential section of memory allocated to contain anything from a character string to an array of integers. Writing outside the bounds of a block of allocated memory can corrupt data, crash the program, or cause the execution of malicious code.

_According to OWASP_

**Some vulnerable applications**: SLmail 5.5, Golden FTP Server 4.70, Ultra MiniHTTPd 1.2, CloudMe 1.11.2, Easy File Sharing Web Server 7.2.

You can practice on these applications. These are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow.
