other than this, we can check whether the application is writing any sensitive logs into memory or not

before using the app, use the following command

`C:\> example.exe > logs.txt`

once you have done testing, check logs.txt and see if any sensitive information has been written.

File Permissions:&#x20;

Commonly, manipulating files created at the installation time should not be permitted. Also, any file that stores application-related information should not have written permission. Else attacker or malicious application could change the information and interfere with the other apps' filesystems.

Fooding attacks:&#x20;

Sending large volumes of data or input can lead to various attacks, from memory corruption to buffer overflow. It is also essential to check whether the application handles input in a better manner or not.
