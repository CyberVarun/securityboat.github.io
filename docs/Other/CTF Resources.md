## **What is CTF?**

Capture The Flag (CTF) is an information security competition that presents participants with a variety of tasks, ranging from scavenger hunts on Wikipedia to basic programming exercises, or even attempting to breach a server to obtain specific data. In these challenges, participants are typically tasked with locating a specific piece of text, often referred to as the "flag," which may be concealed on a server or within a webpage.
