### **Architectures of Thick Clients.**

* Two Tier
* Three Tier

### **Two Tier**:&#x20;

The two-tier is based on Client-Server architecture. The two-tier architecture is like a client-server application. Direct communication takes place between client and server. There is no intermediate between client and server.

### **Three Tier**:&#x20;

The three-tier is based on Client - Application Server - Database Server architecture. The Application server is the mediator between client and server, it transfers data from client to server and vice versa.
