# **Information Gathering**

The architecture of the application: Understand its architecture, whether two-tier or three-tier, to understand where to attack API or directly database-related attacks.

Network analysis: While installing, observe the traffic. It might contain sensitive information, which is a bad practice. Note destination IP and understand how routing works. What's the data flow? These things are important to widen the attack surface.

Tech stack: Using tools such as DetectItEasy, understand which language and version of the framework are used in the application. If the version is vulnerable to any known CVE, we can consider them for further exploitation. also, getting to know which language is used can help while decompiling applications.

Application Workflow: Understanding the application's workflow helps you break into some unique vulnerabilities, such as business logic limited to that application. also, we can call feature or function exploitations
