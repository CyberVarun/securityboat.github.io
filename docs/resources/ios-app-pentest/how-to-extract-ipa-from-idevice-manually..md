**Steps**.

#### **1. Take an SSH shell of iDevice.**

2\. Find the application sandbox directory which is the bundle container of the application.

</div>

```
/var/containers/Bundle/Application/
```

3\. Use the following command to find  .app directory of the application. Ex : `Netflix` in our case.

```
find | grep "Netflix"
```

</div>

4\. Sometimes .app directory may not be the same as the display name of the application. If we do not get the .app directory we are looking for, we can use `ls *` which will list down all the directories. And then search manually.

5\. Now, navigate to the .app directory. (`Netflix` in our case)

6\. Make the folder with the name `Payload.`

7\. Copy the application-specific .app file in the `Payload folder`&#x20;

```
cp -r Argo.app/ Payload/
```

![](<../../attachments/image (35).png>)

8\. Now, we just need to compress the .zip file at desired location as shown.

```
zip -r /var/root/dumpNetflix.ipa Payload/
```

![](<../../attachments/image (41).png>)

9\. For getting the `.ipa` file on the host machine for further analysis we can use `sftp.`

10\. Observe we have a `dumpNetflix.ipa` file in our host machine.&#x20;

```
get -r /var/root/dumpNetflix.ipa
```
