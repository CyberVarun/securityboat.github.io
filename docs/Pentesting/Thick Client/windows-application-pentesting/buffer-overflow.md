# **Buffer Overflow**

## **Definition**
- Occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold or writes data beyond the allocated buffer size.
- Can lead to data corruption, program crashes, or execution of malicious code.

## **Vulnerable Applications**
- SLmail 5.5
- Golden FTP Server 4.70
- Ultra MiniHTTPd 1.2
- CloudMe 1.11.2
- Easy File Sharing Web Server 7.2

## **Practice Targets**
- These applications are susceptible to stack-based buffer overflow attacks.
- Practicing on them helps understand and mitigate such vulnerabilities.

## **Consequences**
- Data Corruption: Overwriting adjacent memory can corrupt data structures.
- Program Crashes: Writing beyond buffer boundaries can cause the program to crash.
- Malicious Code Execution: Attackers can exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities to inject and execute arbitrary code.

## **Mitigation Techniques**
- Input Validation: Ensure input data doesn't exceed buffer limits.
- Bounds Checking: Implement checks to prevent buffer overflow.
- Use Secure Libraries: Utilize functions that handle buffers safely (e.g., `strcpy_s` instead of `strcpy`).
- Code Reviews: Regularly review code for potential vulnerabilities.
- Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR): Randomize memory locations to make it harder for attackers to predict addresses for exploitation.
