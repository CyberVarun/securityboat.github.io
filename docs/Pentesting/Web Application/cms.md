# **CMS Recon** #

### **What is CMS?** ###

A Content Management System (CMS) is a software application used to create, manage, and modify digital content on websites without requiring extensive technical knowledge. It provides users with an intuitive interface to add, edit, and delete content such as text, images, videos, and other multimedia elements. CMS platforms offer various features including user management, publishing workflows, version control, and plugin/extensions support for customization. Popular examples include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, empowering users to efficiently maintain and update their web presence.

## **CMS Reconnaissance** ##
Performing CMS reconnaissance is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities, customizing attack vectors, exploiting known weaknesses, mapping the attack surface, understanding dependencies, detecting hidden functionalities, and gathering intelligence about the target environment. By uncovering the specific CMS being used, along with its configurations, plugins, and extensions, reconnaissance enables a more targeted and comprehensive approach to penetration testing, ultimately enhancing the ability to identify and mitigate security risks within web applications powered by CMS platforms.
