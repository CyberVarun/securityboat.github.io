# **Web Cache Deception**

## **What is Web Cache Deception** ##
Web Cache Deception is a security flaw where an attacker tricks a web cache into storing sensitive information intended for one user and serving it to another. By manipulating URLs or HTTP headers, attackers exploit misconfigurations to cache private data, such as user-specific pages or authentication tokens. Subsequently, when another user requests the same resource, the cache inadvertently serves the sensitive data, leading to potential data exposure or unauthorized access.
