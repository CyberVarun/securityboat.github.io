# **OAuth** #
## **What is OAuth?** ##
OAuth stands for Open Authorization, is a widely used protocol that allows users to grant third-party applications limited access to their resources without sharing their credentials directly. It provides a secure and standardized way for applications to interact with user data on various platforms, such as social media sites or cloud services, without needing to expose sensitive login information. OAuth works by facilitating the exchange of access tokens between the user, the application, and the service provider, enabling seamless authentication and authorization processes while maintaining user privacy and security.
