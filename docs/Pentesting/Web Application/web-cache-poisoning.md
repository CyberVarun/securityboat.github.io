## **What is Web Cache Poisoning?** ##
Web cache poisoning is a security vulnerability where attackers manipulate the content stored in a web cache to serve malicious or unauthorized content to users. By exploiting weaknesses in caching mechanisms, attackers can inject harmful scripts, redirect traffic to malicious sites, or hijack user sessions. This poses risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, data theft, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
