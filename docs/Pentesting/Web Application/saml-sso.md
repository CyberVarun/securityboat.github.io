# **SAML/SSO** #
## **What is SAML\SSO?** ##
SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and SSO (Single Sign-On) are technologies used in identity and access management systems. SAML facilitates secure communication between identity providers (like login systems) and service providers (like web applications), allowing users to access multiple services with a single set of credentials. SSO, on the other hand, enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple connected systems without re-entering credentials. Together, SAML and SSO streamline authentication processes, enhance security, and improve user experience across various applications and services.
