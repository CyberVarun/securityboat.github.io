# **Web App Pentest Checklist** #
A Web Application Penetration Testing Checklist is a structured document outlining steps and tests to assess the security posture of a web application. It typically includes tasks like identifying entry points, testing for common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting), assessing authentication mechanisms, reviewing access controls, examining session management, and scrutinizing data handling processes. Additionally, it covers areas such as error handling, security headers, encryption usage, and compliance with security best practices.
