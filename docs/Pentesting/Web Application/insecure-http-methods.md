To exploit any methods it is important to know which methods are enabled, for that we can simply check via OPTIONS

If that not worked you should definitely try by submitting random word as method. Sometime you might receive and error which shows which methods are implemented.&#x20;

Once we got to know which methods are enabled then we will look for exploit respectively.

* HEAD, GET, POST, and CONNECT are safe HTTP Method. Of course, the request itself may have malicious parameters, but that is separate from the exploiting http Method topic. It is always recommended that disable unnecessary methods.&#x20;
* PUT, DELETE - these methods were initially intended as file management operations. Some web servers still support these in their original format. You can change or delete files from the server's file system arbitrarily. If these are enabled, it opens you to perform some dangerous attacks. Here is the great article to exploit PUT method - [https://www.arridae.com/blogs/HTTP-PUT-method.php](https://www.arridae.com/blogs/HTTP-PUT-method.php)
* OPTIONS: As previously mentioned, we can use this method to identify which other methods are enabled so it can be considered a shortcut to finding another hole. Now, this is not a vulnerability; since there is no actual use for it, it just increases the attack surface and should ideally be disabled. Although the OPTIONS method is used for several legitimate purposes nowadays, for example, some REST APIs require an OPTIONS request, CORS requires pre-flight requests, and so on. So there are scenarios wherein OPTIONS should be enabled, but the default should still be "disabled unless required".
* TRACE - This is also a diagnostic method that returns the entire HTTP Request in the response body. This includes the request body and the request headers, including, e.g. cookies, authorization headers, and more. Not too surprising, this can be substantially misused, such as the classic [Cross-Site Tracing (XST)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross\_Site\_Tracing) attack, wherein an XSS vector can be utilized to retrieve HttpOnly cookies, authorization headers, and such. This should be disabled.
