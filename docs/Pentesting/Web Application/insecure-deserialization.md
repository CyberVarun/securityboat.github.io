# **Insecure Deserialization** #

### **Background Information** ###

**Serialization** is the process of converting complex data structures, such as objects and their fields, into a "flatter" format that can be sent and received as a sequential stream of bytes.

**Deserialization** is the process of restoring this byte stream to a fully functional replica of the original object, in the exact state as when it was serialized.

### **What is Insecure deserialization?** ###
Insecure deserialization vulnerability occurs when untrusted or unknown data is used to either inflict a denial of service attack, execute code, bypass authentication, or further abuse the logic behind an application.&#x20;
