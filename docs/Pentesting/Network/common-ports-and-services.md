# **Common Ports and Services**

### **Port XXX - Service unknown**

If you have a port open with unkown service you can do this to find out which service it might be.

### **Port 21 - FTP**

Connect to the ftp-server to enumerate software and version

Many ftp-servers allow anonymous users. These might be misconfigured and give too much access, and it might also be necessary for certain exploits to work. So always try to log in with `anonymous:anonymous`.

**Remember the binary and ascii mode!**

If you upload a binary file you have to put the ftp-server in binary mode, otherwise the file will become corrupted and you will not be able to use it! The same for text-files. Use ascii mode for them! You just write **binary** and **ascii** to switch mode.

### **Port 22 - SSH**

SSH is such an old and fundamental technology so most modern version are quite hardened. You can find out the version of the SSH either but scanning it with nmap or by connecting with it using `nc`.

It returnes something like this: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH\_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu1

This banner is defined in RFC4253, in chapter 4.2 Protocol Version Exchange. [http://www.openssh.com/txt/rfc4253.txt](http://www.openssh.com/txt/rfc4253.txt) The protocol-version string should be defined like this: `SSH-protoversion-softwareversion SP comments CR LF` Where comments is optional. And SP means space, and CR (carriege return) and LF (Line feed) So basically the comments should be separated by a space.

### **Port 23 - Telnet**

Telnet is considered insecure mainly because it does not encrypt its traffic. Also a quick search in exploit-db will show that there are various RCE-vulnerabilities on different versions. Might be worth checking out.

- **Brute force it**

You can also brute force it like this:

```
hydra -l root -P /root/SecLists/Passwords/10_million_password_list_top_100.txt ip telnet
```

### **Port 25 - SMTP**

SMTP is a server to server service. The user receives or sends emails using IMAP or POP3. Those messages are then routed to the SMTP-server which communicates the email to another server. The SMTP-server has a database with all emails that can receive or send emails. We can use SMTP to query that database for possible email-addresses. Notice that we cannot retrieve any emails from SMTP. We can only send emails.

Here are the possible commands

```
HELO - EHLO - Extended SMTP.STARTTLS - SMTP communicted over unencrypted protocol. By starting TLS-session we encrypt the traffic.RCPT - Address of the recipient.DATA - Starts the transfer of the message contents.RSET - Used to abort the current email transaction.MAIL - Specifies the email address of the sender.QUIT - Closes the connection.HELP - Asks for the help screen.AUTH - Used to authenticate the client to the server.VRFY - Asks the server to verify is the email user's mailbox exists.
```

- #### **Manually**

We can use this service to find out which usernames are in the database. This can be done in the following way.

```
nc ip 25                                                                               ​220 metasploitable.localdomain ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)VRFY root252 2.0.0 rootVRFY roooooot550 5.1.1 : Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table
```

Here we have managed to identify the user `root`. But `roooooot` was rejected.

`VRFY`, `EXPN` and `RCPT` can be used to identify users.

Telnet is a bit more friendly some times. So always use that too

#### **Automatized**

This process can of course be automatized

- **Check for commands**

```
nmap -script smtp-commands.nse ip
```

- **smtp-user-enum**

The command will look like this. `-M` for mode. `-U` for userlist. `-t` for target

```
smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U /root/sectools/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -t ip
```

```
Mode ..................... VRFYWorker Processes ......... 5Usernames file ........... /root/sectools/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txtTarget count ............. 1Username count ........... 8607Target TCP port .......... 25Query timeout ............ 5 secsTarget domain ............ ​######## Scan started at Sun Jun 19 11:04:59 2016 #########ip: Bin exists192.168.1.xxx: Irc exists192.168.1.xxx: Mail exists192.168.1.xx: Man exists192.168.1.xxx: Sys exists######## Scxxxn completed at Sun Jun 19 11:06:51 2016 #########5 results.​8607 queries in 112 seconds (76.8 queries / sec)
```

- **Metasploit**

I can also be done using metasploit

```

### **Port 53 - DNS** 
DNS is crucial for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to communicate over the internet. Port 53 is specifically designated for DNS queries and responses. It facilitates the exchange of DNS information between DNS clients and servers, enabling domain name resolution and internet navigation. This port is fundamental for the proper functioning of the internet's addressing system, allowing users to access websites, send emails, and perform various online activities.

### **Port 69 - TFTP** 

TFTP stands for Trivial File Transfer Protocol. It's a simple protocol used for transferring files between devices on a network. Unlike FTP, which is more complex and feature-rich, TFTP is lightweight and lacks authentication and directory browsing capabilities. It operates over UDP port 69 and is commonly used for bootstrapping devices, such as routers and network switches, during the initial stages of configuration. TFTP is also utilized in scenarios where a fast and lightweight file transfer protocol is required, albeit with limited security features.

### **Port 79 - Finger** 
Finger is a network protocol used to retrieve information about users on a remote system. It operates on TCP port 79 and allows users to query the system for details such as login name, full name, and the last time a user logged in. However, due to security concerns, Finger is often disabled or restricted on modern systems as it can provide attackers with valuable reconnaissance information for potential exploits.

### **Port 80 - HTTP** 

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) communication, the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It's the default port for web browsers to access web pages, allowing them to request and receive web content from web servers. When you type a website URL into your browser, it sends an HTTP request to the server on port 80, which then responds with the requested web page.

We usually just think of vulnerabilities on the http-interface, the web page, when we think of port 80. But with `.htaccess` we are able to password protect certain directories. If that is the case we can brute force that the following way.

#### **Password protect directory with htaccess** 

Create a directory that you want to password-protect. Create .htaccess tile inside that directory.

- Content of .htaccess:

```
AuthType BasicAuthName "Password Protected Area"AuthUserFile /var/www/html/test/.htpasswdRequire valid-user
```

- Create .htpasswd file

```
htpasswd -cb .htpasswd test admin
service apache2 restart
```

This will now create a file called .htpasswd with the user: test and the password: admin

If the directory does not display a login-prompt, you might have to change the **apache2.conf** file. To this:

#### **Brute force it**

Now that we know how this works we can try to brute force it with medusa.

```
medusa -h ip -u admin -P wordlist.txt -M http -m DIR:/test -T 10
```

### **Port 88 - Kerberos**

Kerberos is a protocol that is used for network authentication. Different versions are used by \*nix and Windows. But if you see a machine with port 88 open you can be fairly certain that it is a Windows Domain Controller.

If you already have a login to a user of that domain you might be able to escalate that privilege.

Check out: MS14-068

### **Port 110 - Pop3**

This service is used for fetching emails on a email server. So the server that has this port open is probably an email-server, and other clients on the network (or outside) access this server to fetch their emails.

```
telnet ip 110
USER PASS admin
List all emails: list
Retrive email number 5, for example: retr 5
```

### **Port 111 - Rpcbind**

Rpcbind, is a network service that acts as a mediator for Remote Procedure Call (RPC) requests in Unix-like operating systems. It listens for RPC requests and assigns unique port numbers to RPC services when they register with it. Rpcbind enables clients to locate RPC services dynamically by mapping them to specific port numbers. It plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between client and server applications in networked environments. However, it can also pose security risks if not properly configured, potentially allowing unauthorized access or exploitation of RPC services.

### **Port 119 - NTP**

Network time protocol. It is used synchronize time. If a machine is running this server it might work as a server for synchronizing time. So other machines query this machine for the exact time.

An attacker could use this to change the time. Which might cause denial of service and all around havoc.

### **Port 123 - NTP**

Network Time Protocol (NTP), a crucial service for synchronizing the time on networked devices. NTP ensures that computers and devices maintain accurate time settings by communicating with designated time servers. This port facilitates the exchange of time synchronization information between client devices and NTP servers, enabling precise coordination of time across networks. It plays a vital role in various applications, including network security, logging, and distributed systems, by ensuring that all devices operate on a standardized and synchronized time basis.

### **Port 135 - MSRPC**

This is the windows rpc-port. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft\_RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft\_RPC)​

- #### **Enumerate**

```
nmap ip --script=msrpc-enum
```

```
msf > use exploit/windows/dcerpc/ms03_026_dcom
```

Samba is a service that enables the user to share files with other machines. It has interoperatibility, which means that it can share stuff between linux and windows systems. A windows user will just see an icon for a folder that contains some files. Even though the folder and files really exists on a linux-server.

- #### **Connecting**

```
smbclient //ip/tmpsmbclient \\\\ip\\ipc$ -U john smbclient //ip/ipc$ -U john
```

If you don't provide any password, just click enter, the server might show you the different shares and version of the server. This can be useful information for looking for exploits. There are tons of exploits for smb.

So smb, for a linux-user, is pretty much like and ftp or a nfs.

Here is a good guide for how to configure samba: [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20Create%20a%20Network%20Share%20Via%20Samba%20Via%20CLI%20(Command-line%20interface/Linux%20Terminal)%20-%20Uncomplicated,%20Simple%20and%20Brief%20Way!](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20Create%20a%20Network%20Share%20Via%20Samba%20Via%20CLI%20\(Command-line%20interface/Linux%20Terminal\)%20-%20Uncomplicated,%20Simple%20and%20Brief%20Way!)​

```
mount -t cifs -o user=USERNAME,sec=ntlm,dir_mode=0077 "//ip/My Share" /mnt/cifs
```

- #### **Connectin with PSExec**

If you have credentials you can use psexec you easily log in. You can either use the standalone binary or the metasploit module.

```
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
```

- #### **Scanning with nmap**

Scanning for smb with Nmap

There are several NSE scripts that can be useful, for example:

```
ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb*
```

```

```

- #### **nbtscan**

It can be a bit buggy sometimes so run it several times to make sure it found all users.

- #### **Enum4linux**

Enum4linux can be used to enumerate windows and linux machines with smb-shares.

The do all option:

For info about it ere: [https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/](https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/)​

- #### **rpcclient**

You can also use rpcclient to enumerate the share.

Connect with a null-session. That is, without a user. This only works for older windows servers.

Once connected you could enter commands like

```
srvinfo
enumdomusers
getdompwinfo
querydom
info
netshareenum
netshareenumall
```

### **Port 143/993 - IMAP**

IMAP lets you access email stored on that server. So imagine that you are on a network at work, the emails you recieve is not stored on your computer but on a specific mail-server. So every time you look in your inbox your email-client (like outlook) fetches the emails from the mail-server using imap.

IMAP is a lot like pop3. But with IMAP you can access your email from various devices. With pop3 you can only access them from one device.

Port 993 is the secure port for IMAP.

### **Port 161 and 162 - SNMP**

Simple Network Management Protocol

SNMP protocols 1,2 and 2c does not encrypt its traffic. So it can be intercepted to steal credentials.

SNMP is used to manage devices on a network. It has some funny terminology. For example, instead of using the word password the word community is used instead. But it is kind of the same thing. A common community-string/password is public.

You can have read-only access to the snmp.Often just with the community string `public`.

Common community strings

Here is a longer list of common community strings: [https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Miscellaneous/wordlist-common-snmp-community-strings.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Miscellaneous/wordlist-common-snmp-community-strings.txt)​

- #### **MIB - Management information base**

SNMP stores all teh data in the Management Information Base. The MIB is a database that is organized as a tree. Different branches contains different information. So one branch can be username information, and another can be processes running. The "leaf" or the endpoint is the actual data. If you have read-access to the database you can read through each endpoint in the tree. This can be used with snmpwalk. It walks through the whole database tree and outputs the content.

- **snmpwalk**

```
snmpwalk -c public -v1 ip #community string and which version
```

This command will output a lot of information. Way to much, and most of it will not be relevant to us and much we won't understand really. So it is better to request the info that you are interested in. Here are the locations of the stuff that we are interested in:

```
1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.6.0 System Processes1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2 Running Programs1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.4 Processes Path1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.4 Storage Units1.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2 Software Name1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25 User Accounts1.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3 TCP Local Ports
```

Now we can use this to query the data we really want.

- **snmpenum**

- **snmp-check**

This is a bit easier to use and with a lot prettier output.

```
snmp-check -t ip -c public
```

- #### **Scan for open ports - Nmap**

Since SNMP is using UDP we have to use the `-sU` flag.

```
nmap -iL ips.txt -p 161,162 -sU --open -vvv -oG snmp-nmap.txt
```

- #### **Onesixtyone**

With onesixtyone you can test for open ports but also brute force community strings. I have had more success using onesixtyone than using nmap. So better use both.

- #### **Metasploit**

There are a few snmp modules in metasploit that you can use. snmp\_enum can show you usernames, services, and other stuff.

​[https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/snmp-scan/](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/snmp-scan/)​

### **Port 199 - Smux**
 SNMP multiplexing protocol (SMUX), which facilitates communication between SNMP managers and agents. SMUX allows multiple SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) sub-agents to operate concurrently on a single network device. It enables efficient management and monitoring of network devices by centralizing data collection and control through SNMP. 

### **Port 389/636 - Ldap**

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. This port is usually used for Directories. Directory her means more like a telephone-directory rather than a folder. Ldap directory can be understood a bit like the windows registry. A database-tree. Ldap is sometimes used to store usersinformation. Ldap is used more often in corporate structure. Webapplications can use ldap for authentication. If that is the case it is possible to perform **ldap-injections** which are similar to sqlinjections.

You can sometimes access the ldap using a anonymous login, or with other words no session. This can be useful becasue you might find some valuable data, about users.

```
ldapsearch -h ip -p 389 -x -b "dc=mywebsite,dc=com"
```

When a client connects to the Ldap directory it can use it to query data, or add or remove.

Port 636 is used for SSL.

There are also metasploit modules for Windows 2000 SP4 and Windows Xp SP0/SP1

### **Port 443 - HTTPS**

HTTPS, a secure version of HTTP, the protocol used for web browsing. HTTPS encrypts data exchanged between a user's browser and a website, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. It's commonly used for secure online transactions, login pages, and sensitive data transfer, providing protection against eavesdropping and tampering. Websites using HTTPS have a padlock icon in the browser's address bar, indicating a secure connection.
check for SSL-vulnerabilities such as heartbleed. For more on how to exploit web-applications check out the chapter on client-side vulnerabilities.

- #### **Heartbleed**

OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive) are vulnerable OpenSSL 1.0.1g is NOT vulnerable OpenSSL 1.0.0 branch is NOT vulnerable OpenSSL 0.9.8 branch is NOT vulnerable

First we need to investigate if the https-page is vulnerable to [heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/)​

We can do that the following way.

or using a nmap script

```
nmap -sV --script=ssl-heartbleed ip
```

You can exploit the vulnerability in many different ways. There is a module for it in burp suite, and metasploit also has a module for it.

```
use auxiliary/scanner/ssl/openssl_heartbleedset RHOSTS ipset verbose truerun
```

Now you have a flow of random data, some of it might be of interest to you.

- #### **CRIME**

- #### **Breach**

- #### **Certificate**

Read the certificate.

* Does it include names that might be useful?
* Correct vhost

### **Port 554 - RTSP**

RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) is a stateful protocol built on top of tcp usually used for streaming images. Many commercial IP-cameras are running on this port. They often have a GUI interface, so look out for that.

### **Port 587 - Submission**

Outgoing smtp-port

If Postfix is run on it it could be vunerable to shellshock [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34896/](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34896/)​

### **Port 631 - Cups**

Common UNIX Printing System has become the standard for sharing printers on a linux-network. You will often see port 631 open in your priv-esc enumeration when you run `netstat`. You can log in to it here: [**http://localhost:631/admin**](http://localhost:631/admin)​

You authenticate with the OS-users.

Find version. Test **cups-config --version**. If this does not work surf to [**http://localhost:631/printers**](http://localhost:631/printers) and see the CUPS version in the title bar of your browser.

There are vulnerabilities for it so check your searchsploit.

### **Port 993 - Imap Encrypted**

IMAP, or Internet Message Access Protocol, is a standard email protocol used for accessing email on a remote server. Port 993 specifically employs encryption, typically SSL/TLS, to secure the communication between the email client and the server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data transmission. It's commonly used for retrieving emails from a server securely, especially in environments where data privacy is a priority, such as in corporate or business email systems.

### **Port 995 - POP3 Encrypten**

Port 995 is the default port for the **Post Office Protocol**. The protocol is used for clients to connect to the server and download their emails locally. You usually see this port open on mx-servers. Servers that are meant to send and recieve email.

Related ports: 110 is the POP3 non-encrypted.

25, 465

### **Port 1025 - NFS or IIS**

NFS is a distributed file system protocol allowing clients to access files over a network. Port 1025 is used for NFS-related communication, facilitating the transfer and management of files between clients and servers within a network environment. In contrast, IIS typically uses ports 80 and 443 for HTTP and HTTPS communication.

### **Port 1030/1032/1033/1038**

Ports 1030, 1032, 1033, and 1038 are TCP ports used by various network services. Port 1030 is typically associated with Microsoft System Administration, while ports 1032, 1033, and 1038 have no standard assignments. These ports may be used by specific applications or services depending on system configurations. It's important to note that port numbers can be dynamically assigned or utilized by custom applications, so their exact purpose can vary. Therefore, network administrators should monitor and manage these ports to ensure network security and functionality.

### **Port 1433 - MsSQL**

Microsoft SQL Server (MsSQL), a relational database management system. It's used for communication between client applications and the SQL Server instance. This port facilitates queries, data retrieval, and database management tasks. Typically, organizations configure firewalls to allow traffic on port 1433 for SQL Server connections, both internally and externally.

## **Execute commands**

```
# **To execute the date command to the following after logging inxp_cmdshell 'date'go**
```

Many o the scanning modules in metasploit requires authentication. But some do not.

```
use auxiliary/scanner/mssql/mssql_ping
```

- #### **Brute force**

```
scanner/mssql/mssql_login
```

If you have credencials look in metasploit for other modules.

### **Port 1521 - Oracle database**

Oracle Database, a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle Corporation. This port serves as the default listener port for Oracle Database's SQL*Net protocol, facilitating communication between clients and the Oracle Database server. It is used for establishing connections, executing SQL queries, and managing database operations.

### **Ports 1748, 1754, 1808, 1809 - Oracle**

These are also ports used by oracle on windows. They run Oracles **Intelligent Agent**.

### **Port 2049 - NFS**

Network file system This is a service used so that people can access certain parts of a remote filesystem. If this is badly configured it could mean that you grant excessive access to users.

If the service is on its default port you can run this command to see what the filesystem is sharing

Then you can mount the filesystem to your machine using the following command

```
mount ip:/ /tmp/NFSmount -t ip:/ /tmp/NFS
```

Now we can go to /tmp/NFS and check out /etc/passwd, and add and remove files.

This can be used to escalate privileges if it is not correct configured. Check chapter on Linux Privilege Escalation.

### **Port 2100 - Oracle XML DB**

There are some exploits for this, so check it out. You can use the default Oracle users to access to it. You can use the normal ftp protocol to access it.

Can be accessed through ftp. Some default passwords here: [https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501\_01/win.920/a95490/username.htm](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501\_01/win.920/a95490/username.htm) Name: Version:

Default logins: sys:sys scott:tiger

### **Port 3268 - globalcatLdap**

Global catalog LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) service. The global catalog is a distributed data repository in Microsoft Active Directory that stores information about objects across multiple domains in a forest. Port 3268 facilitates queries to the global catalog, allowing clients to retrieve information about users, groups, and other directory objects from a centralized database. This port is commonly used in environments where Active Directory is deployed to support directory service operations across the network.

### **Port 3306 - MySQL**

MySQL, a widely-used open-source relational database management system. It serves as the default port for MySQL server connections, facilitating the exchange of data between client applications and the MySQL server. Port 3306 enables secure and efficient communication, allowing clients to connect to and interact with MySQL databases for various purposes such as storing, retrieving, and managing structured data.
Always test the following:

**Username: root**

**Password: root**

```
mysql --host=ip -u root -pmysql -h  -u rootmysql -h  -u ""@localhost​telnet ip 3306
```

You will most likely see this a lot:

```
ERROR 1130 (HY000): Host 'ip' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server
```

This occurs because mysql is configured so that the root user is only allowed to log in from 127.0.0.1. This is a reasonable security measure put up to protect the database.

- #### **Uploading a shell**

```
You can also use mysql to upload a shell
```

- #### **Escalating privileges**

If mysql is started as root you might have a chance to use it as a way to escalate your privileges.

- **MYSQL UDF INJECTION:**

- #### **Finding passwords to mysql**

You might gain access to a shell by uploading a reverse-shell. And then you need to escalate your privilege. One way to do that is to look into the databse and see what users and passwords that are available. Maybe someone is resuing a password?

So the first step is to find the login-credencials for the database. Those are usually found in some configuration-file oon the web-server. For example, in joomla they are found in:

```
/var/www/html/configuration.php
```

In that file you find the

```
class JConfig {    var $fromname = 'testuser';    var $sendmail = '/usr/sbin/sendmail';    var $password = 'myPassowrd1234';    var $sitename = 'test';    var $MetaDesc = 'Joomla! - the dynamic portal engine and content management system';    var $MetaKeys = 'joomla, Joomla';    var $offline_message = 'This site is down for maintenance. Please check back again soon.';    }
```

### **Port 3339 - Oracle web interface**

This port is commonly associated with Oracle's web interface, often utilized for accessing and managing Oracle databases through a web browser. This port facilitates communication between client devices and the Oracle database server, allowing users to interact with the database management system remotely. It's an essential component for administering Oracle databases, providing a user-friendly interface for tasks such as database configuration, monitoring, and data manipulation.

### **Port 3389 - Remote Desktop Protocol**

This is a proprietary protocol developed by windows to allow remote desktop.

Log in like this

```
rdesktop -u guest -p guest ip -g 94%
```

Brute force like this

```
ncrack -vv --user Administrator -P /root/passwords.txt rdp://ip
```

- #### **Ms12-020**

This is categorized by microsoft as a RCE vulnerability. But there is no POC for it online. You can only DOS a machine using this exploit.

### **Port 4445 - Upnotifyp**

Upnotifyp may be a custom service or application running on this port. Its exact functionality or purpose can vary depending on the specific implementation. This port could be used for notifications, updates, or other forms of communication within a network or between systems. Users encountering traffic on this port may need to investigate further to determine its origin and intended use within their network infrastructure.

### **Port 4555 - RSIP**

I have seen this port being used by Apache James Remote Configuration.

There is an exploit for version 2.3.2

​[https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/40123.pdf](https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/40123.pdf)​

### **Port 47001 - Windows Remote Management Service**

This service allows remote management and administration of Windows-based systems over a network. It utilizes the WS-Management protocol, enabling administrators to execute commands, retrieve information, and manage systems remotely. Port 47001 is specifically used for secure communication using HTTPS, providing encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure secure remote management of Windows machines.

### **Port 5357 - WSDAPI**

Web Services Dynamic Discovery (WSDAPI) enables devices and services on a network to communicate and discover each other dynamically. It's commonly used for printer and file sharing functionalities in Windows environments. Port 5357 facilitates the exchange of messages between devices and services using the WSDAPI protocol, allowing for seamless discovery and interaction on local networks.

### **Port 5722 - DFSR**

The Distributed File System Replication (DFSR) service is a state-based, multi-master file replication engine that automatically copies updates to files and folders between computers that are participating in a common replication group. DFSR was added in Windows Server 2003 R2.

When this port is open, it is a sign that the machine in question might be a domain controller.

### **Port 5900 - VNC**

VNC is used to get a screen for a remote host. But some of them have some exploits.

You can use vncviewer to connect to a vnc-service. Vncviewer comes built-in in Kali.

It defaults to port 5900. You do not have to set a username. VNC is run as a specific user, so when you use VNC it assumes that user. Also note that the password is not the user password on the machine. If you have dumped and cracked the user password on a machine does not mean you can use them to log in. To find the VNC password you can use the metasploit/meterpreter post exploit module that dumps VNC passwords

```
backgrounduse post/windows/gather/credentials/vncset session Xexploit
```

- #### **Ctr-alt-del**

If you are unable to input ctr-alt-del (kali might interpret it as input for kali).

Try `shift-ctr-alt-del`

#### **Metasploit scanner**

You can scan VNC for logins, with bruteforce.

- **Login scan**

```
use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_loginset rhosts iprun
```

- **Scan for no-auth**

```
use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_none_authset rhosts iprun
```

### **Port 8080**

Since this port is used by many different services. They are divided like this.

#### **Tomcat**

Tomcat suffers from default passwords. There is even a module in metasploit that enumerates common tomcat passwords. And another module for exploiting it and giving you a shell.

### **Port 9389**

Active Directory Administrative Center is installed by default on Windows Server 2008 R2 and is available on Windows 7 when you install the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT).
