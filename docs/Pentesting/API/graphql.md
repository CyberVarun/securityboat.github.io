# **GraphQL API Pentesting**

GraphQL introduces a flexible and powerful way to interact with APIs, but it also brings new security considerations. Here's an overview of GraphQL security, common misconfigurations, and useful tools:

## **Concept**

- **Query Language for APIs:** GraphQL provides a query language for APIs, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need.
- **Runtime for Data Fulfillment:** It serves as a runtime for fulfilling those queries with existing data, providing a complete description of the API data.

## **Common Misconfigurations**

### **Introspection Query**
- **Risk:** Exposing introspection queries to the public can lead to information disclosure, revealing sensitive API details.
- **Recommendation:** Limit access to introspection queries internally and prevent public access to sensitive API information.

## **Tools & Burp Extensions**

- **inql:** A security testing tool for GraphQL APIs that allows for fuzzing, query discovery, and other security testing functionalities.
- **Burp Extensions:** Extensions like "GraphQL Raider" for Burp Suite provide capabilities for scanning and testing GraphQL endpoints for security vulnerabilities.

## **References**
