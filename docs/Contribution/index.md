# Contribution

The SecurityBoat Workbook is an open-source project which is actively maintained and constantly evolving. We welcome contributions in the form of additions, corrections, or updates to the resources and we have implemented a process for these contributions.

## **Want to add or update a section/page?**

Before adding a new section or note, please first search the knowledge base to ensure it doesn't already exist. If it is not present, visit the [discussion board] to see if there are any existing discussions about the topic. If there are none, initiate a new discussion and include all the necessary information below:

### **Format of discussion**

#### **Title**
- A good title should be a short, one-sentence description, contain all relevant information.
