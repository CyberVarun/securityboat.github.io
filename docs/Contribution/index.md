# Contributing

Material for MkDocs is an actively maintained and constantly evolving project
serving a diverse user base with versatile backgrounds and needs. In order to
efficiently address the requirements of all our users, evaluate change requests,
and fix bugs, we put in a lot of work.

Our ever-growing community includes many active users, who open new
issues and discussions several times a day, evolving our 
[discussion board] into a knowledge base – an important addition to
our [documentation] – yielding value to both new and experienced users.

## How you can contribute

We've carefully defined guidelines to improve the overall interaction
within the knowledge base.

  [Code of Conduct]: https://github.com/Securityboat/workbook/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

## Rights and responsibilities

As maintainers, we are entrusted with the __responsibility__ to moderate
communication within our community, including the authority to close, remove,
reject, or edit issues, discussions, comments, commits, and to block users who
__do not align__ with our contribution guidelines and our [Code of Conduct].
This role requires us to be actively involved in maintaining the integrity and
positive atmosphere of our community. Upholding these standards decisively
ensures a respectful and inclusive environment for all members.

### Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct] outlines the expectation for all community members to
treat one another with respect, employing inclusive and welcoming language. Our
commitment is to foster a positive and supportive environment, free of
inappropriate, offensive, or harmful behavior.

We take any violations seriously and will take appropriate action in response to
uphold these values.[^1]

  [^1]:
    __Warning and blocking policy:__
    Given the increasing popularity of our project and our commitment to a
    healthy community, we've defined clear guidelines on how we proceed with
    violations:

    1.1. __First warning:__ Users displaying repeated inappropriate, offensive,
    or harmful behavior will receive a first warning. This warning serves as a
    formal notice that their behavior is not in alignment with our community
    standards and Code of Conduct. The first warning is permanent.

    1.2. __Second warning and opportunity for resolution:__ If the behavior
    persists, a second warning will be issued. Upon receiving the second
    warning, the user will be given a 5-day period for reflection, during which
    they are encouraged to publicly explain or apologize for their actions.
    This period is designed to offer an opportunity for openly clearing out any
    misunderstanding.

    1.3. __Blocking:__ Should there be no response or improvement in behavior
    following the second warning, we reserve the right to block the user from
    the community and repository. Blocking is considered a last resort, used
    only when absolutely necessary to protect the community's integrity and
    positive atmosphere.

    Blocking has been an exceptionally rare necessity in our overwhelmingly
    positive community, highlighting our preference for constructive dialogue
    and mutual respect. It aims to protect our community members and team.

### Incomplete issues and duplicates

  - __Closing incomplete issues:__
  We _reserve the right to close issues lacking essential information_. Issues can be reopened once the missing information has been provided.

  - __Handling duplicates:__ To maintain organized and efficient
  communication within our [discussion board], we
  _reserve the right to close any duplicated issues or lock duplicated
  discussions_. Opening multiple channels to ask the same question or report the
  same issue across different forums hinders our ability to manage and address
  community concerns effectively. This approach is vital for efficient time
  management, as duplicated questions can consume the time of multiple team
  members simultaneously. Ensuring that each issue or discussion is unique and
  progresses with new information helps us to maintain focus and support our
  community.

    We further _reserve the right to immediately close discussions or issues that
    are reopened without providing new information_ or simply because users have
    not yet received a response to their issue/question, as the issue is marked as
    incomplete.
