# Contribution

The SecurityBoat Workbook is an open-source project which is actively maintained and constantly evolving. We welcome contributions in the form of additions, corrections, or updates to the resources and we have implemented a process for these contributions.

## Want to add or update a section/page?

Before adding a new section or note, please first search the knowledge base to ensure it doesn't already exist. If it is not present, visit the [discussion board] to see if there are any existing discussions about the topic. If there are none, initiate a new discussion and include all the necessary information below:

### Format of discussion

#### Title
- A good title should be a short, one-sentence description, contain all relevant information.

| Addition of XYZ resource in ABC page | :material-check:{ style="color: #4DB6AC" } __Clear__

| XYZ Section not found | :material-close:{ style="color: #EF5350" } __Unclear__
| Help | :material-close:{ style="color: #EF5350" } __Useless__

#### Description

## Found a typo?

!!! warning "Issues, discussions, and comments are forever"

    Please note that everything you write is permanent and will remain
    for everyone to read â€“ forever. Therefore, please always be nice and
    constructive, follow our contribution guidelines, and comply with our
    [Code of Conduct].

## Rights and responsibilities

As maintainers, we are entrusted with the __responsibility__ to moderate
communication within our community, including the authority to close, remove,
reject, or edit issues, discussions, comments, commits, and to block users who
__do not align__ with our contribution guidelines and our [Code of Conduct].
This role requires us to be actively involved in maintaining the integrity and
positive atmosphere of our community. Upholding these standards decisively
ensures a respectful and inclusive environment for all members.

### Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct] outlines the expectation for all community members to
treat one another with respect, employing inclusive and welcoming language. Our
commitment is to foster a positive and supportive environment, free of
inappropriate, offensive, or harmful behavior.

We take any violations seriously and will take appropriate action in response to
uphold these values.

### Incomplete issues and duplicates

  - __Closing incomplete issues:__
  We _reserve the right to close issues lacking essential information_. Issues can be reopened once the missing information has been provided.

  - __Handling duplicates:__ To maintain organized and efficient
  communication within our [discussion board], we
  _reserve the right to close any duplicated issues or lock duplicated
  discussions_. Opening multiple channels to ask the same question or report the
  same issue across different forums hinders our ability to manage and address
  community concerns effectively. This approach is vital for efficient time
  management, as duplicated questions can consume the time of multiple team
  members simultaneously. Ensuring that each issue or discussion is unique and
  progresses with new information helps us to maintain focus and support our
  community.

  - We further _reserve the right to immediately close discussions or issues that
    are reopened without providing new information_ or simply because users have
    not yet received a response to their issue/question, as the issue is marked as
    incomplete.
