# **How to Begin Your Bug Bounty Journey**

To start your bug bounty journey, numerous platforms are publicly accessible for anyone interested in joining the bug bounty community. We refrain from naming specific platforms, as we believe it's essential for you to take your first steps independently!

For beginners or individuals entirely new to application security, it's crucial to have a basic understanding of the following:

- Linux
- DNS
- Website functioning
- Data transfer mechanisms
- OWASP top 10 (for both web and mobile)
- Networking basics
- Effective use of search engines

In the bug bounty realm, it's commonly expected that you conduct basic Google searches to find answers. If you can't find a solution, you can always turn to the community on various social platforms for assistance.

## **Learning Linux**

You have the flexibility to choose any Linux distribution for hacking purposes. Some distributions are tailored as hacking environments, offering pre-installed tools. Alternatively, using a mainstream distribution like Ubuntu for hacking can enhance your Linux skills, albeit with occasional installation challenges. Strengthening your Linux proficiency is valuable for scripting automated hacking tools in the future.

## **Understanding DNS and Networking**

Understanding how websites function, the role of DNS, and networking fundamentals like subnets, ports, ASN, TCP, UDP, and ICMP is essential for bug bounty endeavors.

## **Familiarizing with OWASP Top 10**

The OWASP Top 10 serves as a foundational awareness document for developers and application security enthusiasts. It covers vulnerabilities in both web and mobile applications and serves as an excellent starting point for learning about security vulnerabilities.

## **Leveraging Search Engines**

Utilizing search engines effectively is integral to bug hunting. If you encounter difficulties, remember that most answers are readily available on the internet. Engage with the infosec community for guidance and support.

## **Learning Attack Techniques**

In addition to OWASP Top 10, explore platforms that offer insights into various attack vectors and provide lab environments to practice exploiting vulnerabilities.

## **Exercise Patience**

Patience is paramount in bug bounty hunting. Finding your first bug and evolving into a skilled bug hunter takes time and consistent effort. Treat hacking as a continuous learning process.

## **Learning from YouTube Channels**

YouTube is a valuable resource for bug bounty education. Explore recommended channels that cover bug bounty topics comprehensively.

## **Engaging in Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges**

Participating in CTF challenges can enhance your hacking skills. Several platforms offer CTF challenges to help you sharpen your abilities.

## **Selecting Bug Bounty Programs**

When selecting bug bounty programs, prioritize applications you're familiar with as a regular user. Consider your comfort level with web or mobile applications to guide your choice.

## **Dealing with Challenges**

Struggling to find bugs is a common challenge. Remember that setbacks are part of the learning process. Take breaks when needed and return with renewed determination.

## **Handling Duplicates**

Encountering duplicate bugs is normal and indicates you're on the right track. Explore different exploitation methods and attempt to bypass patched vulnerabilities.

## **Exploring Educational Courses**

While there's debate surrounding the efficacy of bug bounty courses, some reputable courses can significantly aid your learning journey. Choose courses wisely to enhance your skills.

## **Final Thoughts**

Embarking on a bug bounty journey requires dedication and patience. While it may lead to frustration and burnout at times, the satisfaction of contributing to cybersecurity and gaining recognition is invaluable.
