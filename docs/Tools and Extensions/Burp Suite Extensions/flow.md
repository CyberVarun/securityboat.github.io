# **Flow**

## **Description**

The Flow extension provides a Proxy history-like view along with search filter capabilities for all Burp Suite tools. It displays requests even without responses, updating them once a response is received.

## **Note**

If you are using the "Platform Authentication" or "Match and Replace" feature of Burp Suite, Flow may not match responses to related requests.

## **Steps to Install**

1. Start Burp Suite.
2. Navigate to the Extender tab.
3. Visit the BApp Store.
4. Search for Flow.
5. Click on Install.
