# **HTTP Request Smuggler**

## **Description**

The **HTTP Request Smuggler** is a go-to Burp extension that allows you to easily detect and exploit web applications for [HTTP Request Smuggling](../../Pentesting/Web%20Application/http-request-smuggling.md). It detects conditions such as CL.TE or TE.CL and reports them directly to Burp Suiteâ€™s Dashboard tab, under the Issue Activity menu where all issues are listed.

To use the HTTP Request Smuggler extension, you first need to install the Turbo Intruder extension, which sends a large number of requests to analyze the result.
