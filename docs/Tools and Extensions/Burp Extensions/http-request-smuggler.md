# **HTTP Request Smuggler**

### **Description**

This is the go-to Burp extension, By using this you can easily detect and exploit a web application for[ HTTP Request Smuggling](../../Pentesting Resources/Web Application/http-request-smuggling.md). It detects whether you have a [CL.TE or TE.CL](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/finding) condition and reports it directly into Burp Suiteâ€™s Dashboard tab, under the Issue Activity menu where all the issues get listed.&#x20;
